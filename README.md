# FlickerForge
A customizable GIF generator mimicking old television static, offering control over colors, blur, dimensions, pixel size and noise pattern.
Made as a project in 2022 for a university course called Scripting Languages.<br><br>


# How to run the program
To install the required packages: <br>
```pip install -r requirements.txt```
<br><br>
To run the program: <br>
```python app.py```
<br><br>

# TODO / Future plans
As it is, this project is anything but complete in my eyes. This is as much a passion project as it was something that helped me complete the course.
In the near future, if I'll have the time, I'd like to extend the functionality of the program and improve its overall performance.<br>
Some ideas I have in mind:
<ul>
  <li>an option to choose between generating a single image or an animation</li>
  <li>the ability to export the generated static in many different formats</li>
  <li>more "noise" patterns</li>
  <li>configurable default generation options</li>
  <li>several generation presets</li>
  <li>an option to set the generated image as the Desktop background or the Lock screen image</li>
</ul>
